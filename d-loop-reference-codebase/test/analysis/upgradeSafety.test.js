      /*
      Analysis: Function selector collisions can occur when two different functions
      hash to the same 4-byte selector. This risk is especially important in Diamond patterns
      where facets are added dynamically.
      
      The DLOOP Diamond implementation should:
      1. Verify no selector collisions during facet addition
      2. Maintain a registry of all active selectors
      3. Reject facets that would create collisions
      
      Example collision risk:
      - function transfer(address,uint256) -> 0xa9059cbb
      - function secondTransfer(address,uint256) -> could potentially collide
      
      Recommendation:
      - Implement explicit collision detection in the Diamond contract
      - Use a well-tested Diamond implementation (like EIP-2535 reference)
      - Maintain comprehensive selector tests during development

      Safe replacement patterns include:
      1. Maintaining the same parameter structure
      2. Preserving the same return value types
      3. Ensuring logical compatibility (same preconditions and postconditions)
      4. Proper access control for replacements

      - invest() -> to add fee calculations
      - divest() -> to add fee calculations
      - ragequit() -> to add penalty calculations

      3. Only adding new fields at the end of structs
      4. Using mapping-based storage for dynamic data

      - Fee configuration (percentages, recipient)
      - Fee collection history
      - Fee governance parameters

      2. Implement migration function to copy data
      3. Update all functions to use new structure
