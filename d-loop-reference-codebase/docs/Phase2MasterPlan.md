## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Every contract function should have dedicated unit tests
- Edge cases and failure modes must be covered
- Fee calculations require precise numerical tests

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end flows for each major function:
  - Fee collection and distribution
  - AI node verification and governance
  - Reward tracking and distribution
  - Cross-chain transfers

### Property-Based Testing
- Use Echidna to verify critical invariants:
  - Fee calculations never exceed input amounts
  - Reward distribution preserves token balances
  - Bridge operations maintain token supply invariants

### Security Testing
- Audit for reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Test access control for all privileged functions
- Verify economic incentives against attack scenarios

## Deployment Plan

### 1. Testnet Deployment
- Deploy full system to Sepolia testnet
- Conduct comprehensive testing on testnet
- Verify all integrations and calculations

### 2. Mainnet Deployment
- Deploy contracts in sequential stages
- Start with minimal functionality and expand
- Conduct rigorous verification at each step

### 3. Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Monitor transaction patterns and gas usage
- Track fee collection and distribution
- Verify governance parameter adjustments
