# DLOOP Smart Contract Test Coverage Expansion Plan

## Objective
Achieve 95%+ test coverage across all smart contracts, focusing on edge cases and integration points.

## Current Test Coverage Assessment

Based on the existing test files, we have coverage for core components but need to expand on:
1. Edge cases in critical functions
2. Integration points between different components
3. Cross-contract interactions
4. Failure modes and recovery scenarios
5. Boundary conditions for all numerical operations

## Target Components for Enhanced Coverage

### 1. Asset Governance Rewards System
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Reward calculations with extreme voting patterns
  - Zero rewards distribution periods
  - Maximum rewards scenarios
  - Oracle price edge conditions (zero, extremely high, unchanged)
  
- **Integration Tests:**
  - GovernanceRewards + GovernanceTracker + RewardAllocator full lifecycle
  - Oracle integration with reward calculation
  - Monthly distribution boundary conditions

### 2. Protocol DAO with AI Voting
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Quorum exactly at threshold (30% and 40%)
  - Voting period boundaries (just before/after deadline)
  - Timelock bypassing attempts
  - Executor failure handling
  
- **Integration Tests:**
  - AI node verification through complete governance cycle
  - Multi-proposal interaction scenarios
  - Timelock + execution interaction
  - Proposal cancellation and resubmission

### 3. Asset DAO Fee Structure
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Fee calculation with minimum and maximum amounts
  - Fee distribution with dust amounts
  - Treasury overflow/underflow scenarios
  - Zero-fee test cases
  
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Full fee lifecycle from calculation to distribution
  - Fee adjustment via Parameter Adjuster
  - Treasury withdrawal and allocation
  - RewardDistributor interaction with fees

### 4. AI Node Identification System
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Soulbound NFT transfer prevention
  - Permission boundary testing
  - Registry maximum capacity
  - Deregistration and reregistration flows
  
- **Integration Tests:**
  - AI node registration to governance participation
  - Identifier + Registry + Governance complete flow
  - Permission inheritance and delegation

### 5. Hedera Bridge
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Rate limiting at exact thresholds
  - Failed cross-chain messages
  - Token bridging with dust amounts
  - Maximum/minimum transfer amounts
  
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Complete token bridging lifecycle
  - Message verification failure recovery
  - Cross-chain governance actions
  - Emergency procedures during bridge failures

## Test Types to Implement

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Function-level testing with various inputs
   - Function output validation
   - State change verification
   
2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Multi-contract interaction scenarios
   - End-to-end workflow validation
   - Cross-component dependencies
   
3. **Property-Based Tests:**
   - Invariant verification under various inputs
   - Fuzz testing critical functions
   - Boundary exploration
   
4. **Security Tests:**
   - Access control validation
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Oracle manipulation resistance
   - Gas-limit DoS protection

5. **Regression Tests:**
   - Verification of previously fixed issues
   - Compatibility with upgraded components

## Testing Tools & Techniques

1. **Hardhat Test Suites:**
   - Time manipulation for governance periods
   - State snapshot manipulation
   - Contract deployment fixtures
   
2. **Echidna Property Testing:**
   - Define invariants for critical components
   - Fuzz test numerical operations
   - Explore failure modes
   
3. **Test Metrics:**
   - Line coverage tracking
   - Branch coverage analysis
   - Function coverage reporting
   - Statement coverage verification

## Implementation Strategy

1. Identify current coverage gaps using Solidity Coverage reports
2. Prioritize critical components (governance, treasury, bridge)
3. Develop targeted test cases for each gap
4. Implement integration tests for component interfaces
5. Add property-based tests for invariant verification
6. Create regression tests for known edge cases
7. Document coverage improvements and remaining gaps
