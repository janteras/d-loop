# DLOOP System Architecture

## Overview

The DLOOP system is a comprehensive blockchain-based governance platform that combines AI node participation with traditional human governance. This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, explaining how the various components interact to create a cohesive ecosystem.

## Core Components

### Identity and Verification

- **AINodeRegistry**: Central registry for AI node registration, verification, and status tracking.
- **SoulboundNFT**: Non-transferable credential tokens for verified AI nodes.

### Governance

- **Protocol DAO**: Manages protocol-wide governance and decision making.
- **Asset DAO**: Manages individual asset pools with automated fee mechanisms.

### Fee System

- **FeeCalculator**: Determines and calculates fee structures for different operations.
- **Treasury**: Manages collected fees and protocol funds.

### Rewards

- **GovernanceRewards**: Tracks participation and calculates reward amounts.
- **RewardDistributor**: Handles the actual distribution of rewards to participants.

### Oracles

- **PriceOracle**: Manages price feeds for various tokens in the ecosystem.

### Tokens

- **DAIToken**: The main governance and utility token of the platform.

## System Interactions

### AI Node Registration and Verification Flow

1. A new AI node is registered through the AINodeRegistry.
2. After verification, the AINodeRegistry instructs SoulboundNFT to mint a credential token for the AI node.
3. The AI node is now recognized in the system and can participate in governance with special privileges.

### Investment Flow with Fees

1. A user initiates an investment through the Asset DAO.
2. The Asset DAO consults the FeeCalculator to determine the appropriate investment fee.
3. The Asset DAO collects the fee and sends it to the Treasury.
4. The Treasury allocates a portion of the fee for rewards distribution.
5. The investment is processed, and tokens are minted to the user.

### Governance Participation and Rewards

1. The Protocol DAO initiates a governance proposal.
2. GovernanceRewards creates a new reward period aligned with the proposal voting period.
3. Participants (both AI nodes and humans) vote on the proposal.
4. The GovernanceRewards contract records participation.
5. After the voting period, the GovernanceRewards contract calculates reward amounts.
6. The RewardDistributor distributes rewards to participants based on these calculations.

### Oracle Price Updates

1. Authorized price feeders update token prices in the PriceOracle.
2. The PriceOracle ensures price deviations are within acceptable ranges.
3. Other contracts (Asset DAO, Treasury, etc.) use these prices for various calculations.

## Cross-Contract Dependencies

- **AINodeRegistry** → **SoulboundNFT**: For credential issuance
- **Asset DAO** → **FeeCalculator**: For fee calculation
- **Asset DAO** → **Treasury**: For fee collection
- **RewardDistributor** → **GovernanceRewards**: For reward calculation
- **All Contracts** → **PriceOracle**: For price information
- **Protocol DAO** → **AINodeRegistry**: For AI node verification

## Security Model

The system employs a comprehensive security model:

1. **Role-based Access Control**: Each contract implements granular role-based permissions.
2. **Upgradability Pattern**: Contracts follow the UUPS upgradeability pattern for future improvements.
3. **Fail-safe Mechanisms**: Checks for price deviations, stale data, and other anomalies.
4. **Event Transparency**: All significant actions emit events for auditability.
5. **Status Tracking**: Active/inactive status flags allow for quick response to issues.

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment process follows a specific sequence to ensure proper contract initialization:

1. Deploy identity contracts (SoulboundNFT, AINodeRegistry)
2. Deploy fee system (FeeCalculator, Treasury)
3. Deploy oracle contracts (PriceOracle)
4. Deploy governance contracts (Protocol DAO, Asset DAO)
5. Deploy reward contracts (GovernanceRewards, RewardDistributor)
6. Configure cross-contract references

Each contract is deployed using initializer functions that set up roles and initial parameters.

## Governance Mechanics

### Special AI Node Governance Rules

AI nodes have different governance parameters:

1. **Shorter Voting Windows**: AI nodes have a 1-day voting window vs. 7 days for humans.
2. **Different Reward Allocation**: Separate reward pools for AI nodes and humans.
3. **Credential Requirements**: AI nodes must have valid SoulboundNFT credentials to participate.

### Fee Structure

The system implements a three-tiered fee structure:

1. **Investment Fee**: 10% fee on new investments
2. **Divestment Fee**: 5% fee on standard divestments
3. **Rage Quit Fee**: 20% fee on rage quits (early withdrawals)

Fees are distributed:
- 70% to Treasury for protocol operations
- 30% to RewardDistributor for governance rewards

## Upgrade Strategy

The system follows a phased upgrade strategy:

1. All contracts implement the UUPS upgradeability pattern.
2. The UPGRADER_ROLE is restricted to trusted addresses.
3. Upgrades are governed by the Protocol DAO.
4. Each upgrade should maintain backward compatibility with existing data.

## Conclusion

The DLOOP architecture creates a robust, integrated ecosystem for AI-enhanced blockchain governance. By carefully designing the interactions between various components, the system ensures secure, transparent, and efficient operation while providing appropriate incentives for participation and contribution.

The modular design allows for future expansion and adaptation to meet evolving needs, while the robust security model protects user assets and protocol integrity.
