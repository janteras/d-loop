# AssetDAO & PriceOracle (Sepolia Release) — Action Plan

## 1. **Context & Objective**
This plan documents the successful upgrade and integration of the D-Loop Protocol's AssetDAO and PriceOracle components for the Sepolia release, with a focus on robust, test-driven Chainlink oracle adoption. It reflects the latest project status and outlines future extensibility steps. Reference materials include:
- [d-loop-whitepaper.md](./d-loop-whitepaper.md)
- [d-loop-supplementary-features.md](./d-loop-supplementary-features.md)
- [PriceOracleReport.md](./PriceOracleReport.md)
- [d-loop-reference-codebase.txt](./d-loop-reference-codebase.txt)

## 2. **Key Findings**
### PriceOracle.sol Status Update
- **Current Implementation:** Now fully integrated with ChainlinkPriceOracle.sol for Sepolia. Manual price updates are supported only as a fallback for unsupported tokens or test scenarios. Robust staleness checks and fallback logic are implemented.
- **Impact:** AssetDAO, FeeCalculator, and all dependent contracts now consume price data from ChainlinkPriceOracle, ensuring accurate, up-to-date, and testnet-flexible price feeds for investment, rewards, and mint/burn flows.

### Reference Codebase Opportunities
- `d-loop-reference-codebase.txt` contains:
  - `oracles/ChainlinkPriceOracle.sol` — likely a Chainlink-integrated implementation.
  - `oracles/IPriceOracle.sol`, `MockPriceOracle.sol`, `OracleAdapter.sol`, etc. — useful for interface standardization and testing.
  - Scripts: `configure-sepolia-price-feeds.js`, `deploy-oracle-rewards.js` — can assist with deployment/testing.

## 3. **Sepolia (Testnet) Action Plan**

### Step 1: Reference & Assess
- Review `oracles/ChainlinkPriceOracle.sol` and `IPriceOracle.sol` in the reference codebase for interface and integration patterns.
- Compare with current `/contracts/oracles/PriceOracle.sol` and `/contracts/interfaces/oracle/IPriceOracle.sol` for compatibility.
- Review `AssetDAO.sol` for all points of oracle dependency (price reads, staleness checks, reward calculations).

### Step 2: Chainlink Oracle Integration (Completed)
- **Adopted** the interface and structure from `ChainlinkPriceOracle.sol` for Sepolia:
  - Uses `AggregatorV3Interface` for ETH/USD, DAI/USD, etc.
  - Supports fallback/manual price updates for unsupported tokens or testnet scenarios.
  - Implements robust staleness and reliability checks.
- **Refactored** `AssetDAO`, `FeeCalculator`, and all consumers to use the new interface.
- **Documented** all integration details and testnet-specific notes in `TESTNET_README.md` and protocol docs.

### Step 3: Test-Driven Implementation (Completed)
- **Extracted** and adapted tests from the reference codebase:
  - `oracles/OraclePriceEvaluator.test.js` (oracle logic)
  - `integration/oracle-governance-integration.test.js` (integration)
  - `mocks/MockPriceOracle.sol` for testnet and testing
- **Wrote/Adapted** additional tests for:
  - Chainlink integration (mock feeds, response simulation)
  - AssetDAO flows (investment, rewards, mint/burn with new oracle)
  - Staleness and fallback scenarios
- **Ran** all relevant tests; all tests now pass for the integrated solution.

### Step 4: Deployment & Scripts (Completed)
- Adapted `configure-sepolia-price-feeds.js` and `deploy-oracle-rewards.js` for Sepolia deployment.
- Ensured deployment scripts are compatible with the current Hardhat/Foundry setup.

### Step 5: Documentation & Compliance (Completed)
- Updated `TESTNET_README.md` and project docs with:
  - Oracle integration details
  - Testnet-specific deviations or limitations
  - References to all reused code and test cases

## 4. **Mainnet & Extensibility Considerations**

### Future Mainnet Requirements
- **Multi-oracle support:** Plan for integrating additional oracle providers (API3, UMA, etc.) via adapters and aggregation logic.
- **Mainnet role management:** Enforce stricter admin/manager roles and limit manual overrides as per whitepaper.
- **Cross-chain compatibility:** Prepare for future cross-chain price feeds and governance flows.
- **Audit & formal verification:** Schedule comprehensive security reviews before mainnet deployment.

### Outstanding Oracle Development (Next Phases)
- **Multi-oracle aggregation:** Design and implement OracleAdapter logic for aggregation/selection among multiple providers (Chainlink, API3, UMA, etc.), supporting redundancy and median selection.
- **Mainnet-grade security:** Upgrade admin/manager permissions with multisig and time-locks for critical actions (feed changes, admin transfer).
- **Advanced reliability & fallback:** Add automated reliability scoring, escalation logic for fallback, and on-chain/off-chain event notifications for price staleness or oracle failures.
- **Cross-chain integration:** Develop adapters/relayers for secure cross-chain price feeds and governance flows (e.g., LayerZero, Wormhole).
- **Upgradeability & modularization:** Refactor oracles to support modular/facet-based upgrades (consider diamond pattern architecture or upgradable proxies).
- **Audit & formal verification:** Schedule mainnet-grade security audits and formal verification of oracle logic.
- **Documentation & test coverage:** Expand documentation for multi-oracle design, mainnet security, and extensibility. Broaden test coverage for edge cases (oracle failure, rapid price changes, cross-chain sync).

## 5. **References for Reuse**
- `oracles/ChainlinkPriceOracle.sol` — main source for Chainlink logic
- `oracles/IPriceOracle.sol` — interface standardization
- `oracles/MockPriceOracle.sol` — for testing/mocks
- `integration/oracle-governance-integration.test.js` — integration test patterns
- `scripts/configure-sepolia-price-feeds.js` — deployment/testing utility

**The above steps reflect the current, completed status for Sepolia and set the stage for robust, extensible mainnet and cross-chain deployments.**
